| **Solana CLI**    | ‚â•‚ÄØ1.18.14 | `solana-install init 1.18.14`                                                      |

| **Node.js**       | ‚â•‚ÄØ18 LTS  | Needed for the Mocha test suite                                                    |

### 1.2¬†Clone & Build

```bash
# Fork first, then:
git clone https://github.com/Takashi-Doyle/merkledrop-rns-contract.git
cd merkledrop-rns-contract
yarn install
anchor build
anchor test        # spins up local validator & runs full suite
```

---

## 2. Ground Rules

* Be respectful ‚Äì follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
* Open an **issue** before starting work on large changes.
* Keep the contract **ultra‚Äëlight** ‚Äì new features that increase state size need a clear rationale.
* Prefer **pure‚Äëfunction** helpers and explicit, typed errors for auditability.

---

## 3. Development Workflow

1. **Create a branch**:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feat/<short-description>
   ```
2. **Run all tests** (`anchor test`) ‚Äì they must pass before PR.
3. **Add/Update tests** for new logic or bug fixes.
4. **Lint & format**:

   ```bash
   cargo fmt --all
   cargo clippy -- -D warnings
   yarn format     # if you add JS/TS files
   ```
5. **Push & open PR** to `main`. Fill in the PR template.

---

## 4. Commit & PR Guidelines

* Use **Conventional Commits**: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `test:`, `refactor:`.
* Squash commits or mark the PR **‚ÄúSquash & Merge.‚Äù**
* PR description must include:

  * **Problem / motivation**
  * **Proposed solution**
  * **Gas / rent impact** (if state layout changes)
  * **Security considerations**

---

## 5. Testing

* Tests live in `tests/airdrop.ts` (Mocha + Anchor local validator).
* Every new feature **must** have covering tests.
* For claim-tracking logic, include a failing test first (red/green).

---

## 6. Continuous Integration

GitHub Actions will automatically run:

* `cargo fmt -- --check`
* `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`
* `anchor test`
* `yarn lint && yarn test` (if front‚Äëend helpers are modified)

CI **must be green** before a maintainer reviews.

---

## 7. Security Disclosures

If you believe you have found a vulnerability:

1. Email **[info@arthimium.com](mailto:info@arthimium.com)** with subject **SECURITY ISSUE**.
2. Include detailed reproduction steps.
3. *Please do not create a public GitHub issue* until we have coordinated a fix.

We follow a **90‚Äëday responsible‚Äëdisclosure window**.

Add a sign‚Äëoff line to each commit:

```bash
